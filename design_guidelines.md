# Design Guidelines: Sentient Design Web App

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from modern design thinking platforms like Linear, Notion, and Framer - emphasizing clean typography, generous whitespace, and progressive disclosure of complex concepts.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Deep Tech Blue: 220 85% 15% (primary brand)
- Electric Cyan: 190 100% 50% (accent for interactive elements)
- Neural Purple: 270 70% 25% (secondary accent)

**Supporting Colors:**
- Pure White: 0 0% 100% (backgrounds)
- Soft Gray: 220 10% 95% (subtle backgrounds)
- Charcoal: 220 15% 20% (primary text)
- Medium Gray: 220 10% 60% (secondary text)

### Typography
**Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- Headlines: 700 weight, 2.5rem to 4rem
- Subheadings: 600 weight, 1.5rem to 2rem
- Body: 400 weight, 1rem line-height 1.6
- Captions: 400 weight, 0.875rem

**Accent Font**: JetBrains Mono (for code-like elements and technical terms)

### Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24
- Consistent 4-unit grid system
- Generous whitespace between sections (24 units)
- Component internal spacing (4-8 units)

### Component Library

**Navigation**: Sticky header with clean typography, subtle shadows
**Hero Section**: Large typography with animated gradient text effects
**Cards**: Subtle borders, hover elevation, rounded corners (8px)
**Interactive Elements**: Smooth hover states, electric cyan accents
**Pattern Showcases**: Grid layouts with visual examples and descriptions

### Visual Treatment

**Gradients**: 
- Hero text: Electric cyan to neural purple diagonal
- Accent backgrounds: Subtle blue-to-purple radials
- Card hover states: Linear blue-to-cyan overlays

**Animations**: 
- Minimal, purposeful transitions (300ms ease-out)
- Text reveals on scroll
- Gentle card hover elevations
- Smooth section transitions

## Images
**Hero Section**: Abstract visualization of AI/brain networks - geometric lines connecting nodes in space, rendered in the brand color palette. Should occupy 60% of viewport height.

**Pattern Examples**: Clean mockup screenshots showing each design pattern (Pinocho, Lienzo Inteligente, UI a Medida) as interface previews with subtle drop shadows.

**Section Dividers**: Minimal geometric shapes or subtle line art representing the evolution from traditional to sentient design.

## Content Strategy
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex concepts revealed through interactive elements
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear section breaks with distinctive headings
- **Bilingual Considerations**: Spanish content with technical English terms highlighted
- **Scannable Format**: Bullet points, numbered lists, and clear subsections

## Interaction Patterns
- **Scroll-triggered Animations**: Content fades in as sections enter viewport
- **Hover States**: Subtle elevations and color transitions
- **Interactive Cards**: Clickable pattern examples with expanded details
- **Smooth Navigation**: Anchor links with smooth scrolling between sections

This approach balances professional credibility with forward-thinking aesthetics, perfect for presenting cutting-edge design concepts while maintaining accessibility and clarity.
